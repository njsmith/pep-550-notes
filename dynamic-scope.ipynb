    "then conceptually we're using [dynamic scoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28computer_science%29#Dynamic_scoping): you can think of it as, whenever you do a decimal operation, and the decimal module needs to find the current decimal context, then it walks up the callstack until it finds the first enclosing `with decimal.localcontext(...)`, and uses that. (Of course the actual implementation is different, but from the user point of view, this is the illusion it's trying to maintain.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, this is different than Python's normal scoping rules. Normal variable lookup in Python uses \"static scoping\": if it can't find a variable locally, then it looks around in the enclosing *file*, not in the *runtime caller*. 99% of the time this is what you want. But the other 1% of the time you have something like the decimal context, or numpy's errstate, or the flask request object, and you actually do want dynamic scoping. But given how rich Python's semantics are – especially around generators – it turns out that right now it's almost impossible to actually implement dynamic scoping properly in Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one example of proper dynamic scoping already built into the interpreter: `sys.exc_info`, which you can access inside an `except:` or `finally:` block to get information about the exception that's currently being handled. Let's walk through some examples to see how the interpreter handles `sys.exc_info`, and why we currently can't make the decimal context work similarly."

    "# Conclusion and takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "First, this is the example that currently, `decimal.localcontext` and friends *cannot get right*. You cannot fake this with a thread-local + saving/restoring values, so right now there is no way to do what `exc_info` does in pure Python. Which is problematic, because if you think about it, this last example is something that comes up all the time async/await code: all it requires is that you use `await` inside an `except` or `finally` block. If `exc_info` didn't handle this case correctly, then async/await wouldn't work at all. But if you use `await` inside a `decimal.localcontext` block, that doesn't work – it can \"leak\" across different coroutine callstacks. The only reason we get away with this right now is that people don't use `decimal.localcontext` much. Fixing this is what motivates PEP 550.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, here's the problem: in first draft of PEP 550, the idea is basically to add the concept of \"generator local\" variables, as a refinement of \"thread local variables\". This allows you to get the behavior in the second generator example. But what it *can't* do is give us the behavior in the *first* generator example – the \"warm up\" example. If we used PEP 550 context to store `exc_info`, then it would be set once when we first started the generator, and then wouldn't change after that – it couldn't \"see\" the calling context. And this would be bad because it, for example, breaks implicit exception chaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "tl;dr: we have one way to do things that works on example 1 but breaks on example 2, and a proposal that works on example 2 but breaks on example 1. Maybe PEP 550's goal should be to allow pure Python code to implement real dynamic scoping, like `exc_info` does, so we can handle both examples correctly at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bonus appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, `exc_info`'s dynamic scoping is a bit buggy in edge cases. Here's a version of the single/double-nested example from above, but now we've factored out the inner `try`/`except` into a generator. It should work the same... but it doesn't; the exception context gets lost:"
